# Vue API

This is the official Vue API repository.

## What is Vue API

Vue API is a powerful and flexible library designed to streamline API management in Vue 3 and Nuxt 3 applications. It provides an organized approach to handling API calls, making your codebase more maintainable and efficient.

The core is built on top of the Vue.js framework and is compatible with both Vue 3 and Nuxt 3.
