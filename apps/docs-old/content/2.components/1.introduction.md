# Components

In the Components section, you will find a variety of pre-designed building blocks that you can use to create a user interface for your application. These components are grouped into three main categories:

[Elements](/components/elements/button): are basic building blocks for your interface, such as buttons.

[Form](/components/form/introduction): includes components that are commonly used in forms, such as input fields for text, email, password, and numbers.

[Other](/components/other/icon): includes additional components that do not fit into the other categories, such as icons.

Please note that these categories are not set in stone, and you may find that a component could fit into more than one category. However, we hope that these groupings will help you navigate the components section and find what you need more easily.
