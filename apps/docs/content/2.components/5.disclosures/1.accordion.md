# VAccordion

The `VAccordion` component provides an easy way to create collapsible content panels, allowing users to expand and collapse sections as needed. This component is built with accessibility in mind and can be easily customized to suit your design requirements.

# Usage

To use the `VAccordion` component, simply wrap your `VAccordionItem` components within a VAccordion parent component:

::Accordion
::

```vue [Example.vue]
<template>
  <VAccordion v-model:activeIndex="activeIndex">
    <VAccordionItem header="A Brief History of Time">
      A Brief History of Time, written by the famous physicist Stephen Hawking, ...
    </VAccordionItem>
    <VAccordionItem header="The Catcher in the Rye">
      The Catcher in the Rye is a classic novel by J.D. Salinger, published ...
    </VAccordionItem>
  </VAccordion>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
const activeIndex = ref(1);
</script>
```

# Active Index

The `activeIndex` prop can be either a number representing the index of a single `VAccordionItem` or an array of numbers for multiple active items. The index refers to the order in which the `VAccordionItem` components are inserted.

By default, only one `VAccordionItem` can be expanded at a time. To allow multiple expanded items, set the `multiple` prop to true.

::AccordionMultiple
::

```vue [Example.vue]
<template>
  <VAccordion v-model:activeIndex="activeIndex" multiple>
    <VAccordionItem header="A Brief History of Time">
      A Brief History of Time, written by the famous physicist Stephen Hawking, ...
    </VAccordionItem>
    <VAccordionItem header="The Catcher in the Rye">
      The Catcher in the Rye is a classic novel by J.D. Salinger, published ...
    </VAccordionItem>
  </VAccordion>
</template>

<script lang="ts" setup>
const activeIndex = ref([1]);
</script>
```
