# VInputPassword

Vunix has a component called `VInputPassword` that includes a toggle button to show or hide the password. This component is an extension of `VInputBase`, so you can check all the features of `VInputBase` [here](/components/form/inputbase).

::alert{type="info"}
Note that `VInputPassword` does not have default password validation. Please refer to the [rules section](/components/form/rules) for information on how to add custom validation to your input.
