# Introduction

Vue API is a powerful and flexible library designed to streamline API management in Vue 3 and Nuxt 3 applications. It provides an organized approach to handling API calls, making your codebase more maintainable and efficient.

## Key Features

1. **Organized API Management**: Vue API allows you to structure your API calls within directories, promoting clear organization and easy reuse across your application.

2. **Automatic Composable Generation**: Based on your directory structure, Vue API automatically generates composables with intuitive naming conventions, simplifying usage throughout your project.

3. **Advanced Data Mapping**: Transform and optimize API responses to fit your front-end needs using powerful mapping functions, ensuring data consistency and reducing redundant processing.

4. **Framework Agnostic**: While the core functionality is designed to work seamlessly with Vue 3, Vue API also offers additional modules for integration with Nuxt 3, making it versatile for different project setups.

5. **SSR Compatibility**: Vue API is built with server-side rendering in mind, including support for Nuxt 3's useAsyncData for smooth hydration.

6. **Flexible Provider Support**: Currently, Vue API supports `ofetch` as its primary HTTP client, with plans to expand support to other popular providers like `axios` and `GraphQL` in future updates.

## Why Use Vue API?

- **Improved Code Organization**: By structuring API calls in a standardized way, Vue API helps maintain a clean and scalable codebase.
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: Automatic composable generation saves time and reduces repetitive code.
- **Enhanced Performance**: With built-in data mapping capabilities, you can optimize API responses for your specific needs, potentially improving application performance.
- **Future-Proof**: As your project grows, Vue API's organized approach makes it easier to manage and update API integrations.
